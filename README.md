### How to Google Like a Pro 🔍

Sometimes, you might get stuck. Don't worry, even the best of us need a little help from our search engines. Here are some pro tips to Google your way out of any CSS conundrum:

1.  **Exact Search**: Looking for something specific? Use quotes to search for the exact phrase: `"your search term"`
2.  **Site Search**: Want results from a particular site? Use `site:example.com search term`
3.  **Excluding Terms**: Too much clutter? Exclude certain words with a minus sign: `search term -exclude`
4.  **After a Specific Date**: Need recent info? Use `after:YYYY-MM-DD`
5.  **Range**: Searching within a range? Use two dots: `start..end`
6.  **Compare or One or the Other**: Looking for options? Use parentheses and a pipe: `(option1|option2) term`
7.  **Wildcard Search**: Unsure of the exact word? Use an asterisk: `*search term`
8.  **Specific Filetype**: Need a particular file type? Use `filetype:pdf search term`

### Example Searches:

- Find articles on CSS Grid published after January 1, 2021: `CSS Grid after:2021-01-01`
- Look for Flexbox tutorials on CSS-Tricks: `site:css-tricks.com Flexbox`
- Exclude Bootstrap from your CSS framework search: `CSS frameworks -Bootstrap`
- Find PDF resources on CSS animations: `CSS animations filetype:pdf`
